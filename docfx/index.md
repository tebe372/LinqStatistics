## Welcome to **LinqStatistics**.
LinqStatistics is a .Net library that offers basic statisitacl extension methods, modeled after the built in Enumerable.Sum and Average.

Methods include:
- Covariance
- Median
- Mode
- Pearson's Chi Squared
- Range
- Standard Deviation (sample and population)
- Variance (sample and population)
- Root Mean Square
- Least Squares
- CountEach
- Histogram

Each with overloads for the intrinsic numeric data types, as appropriate.

LinqStatistics isn't a high performance analysis package. It's meant for those times when your app just needs some simple stats without a lot of fuss.
